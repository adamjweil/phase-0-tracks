Release #2: View a Many-to-Many Relationship

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

	(QUERY) ---> SELECT * FROM reviews LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
	(OUTPUT)
		1|3|The casino is so-so, drinks are good, but not too many games|5|4|5|Cal's Casino|4|Matt|James
		2|5|This is the best pizza in the world! Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!|2|1|2|Bill's Pizza|1|Adam|Weil
		3|4|I've had a lot of BBQ, and this is definitely better than most|4|2|4|Bonnie's BBQ|2|Nicole|Murakami
		4|1|TERRIBLE SERVICE! NOT COMMING BACK!|3|5|3|Teddy's Tennis Courts|5|Tom|Barron
		5|5|BEST Ice Cream EVERRRRRR|1|1|1|Polly's Ice Cream|1|Adam|Weil


3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

	(QUERY) -- >  SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
	(OUTPUT)
		Matt|James|Cal's Casino|3|The casino is so-so, drinks are good, but not too many games
		Adam|Weil|Bill's Pizza|5|This is the best pizza in the world! Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!
		Nicole|Murakami|Bonnie's BBQ|4|I've had a lot of BBQ, and this is definitely better than most
		Tom|Barron|Teddy's Tennis Courts|1|TERRIBLE SERVICE! NOT COMMING BACK!
		Adam|Weil|Polly's Ice Cream|5|BEST Ice Cream EVERRRRRR

	(ORGANIZED VERSION of ^^ QUERY)  --->  SELECT reviews.id, users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
	(OUTPUT)
		1|Matt|James|Cal's Casino|3|The casino is so-so, drinks are good, but not too many games
		2|Adam|Weil|Bill's Pizza|5|This is the best pizza in the world! Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!
		3|Nicole|Murakami|Bonnie's BBQ|4|I've had a lot of BBQ, and this is definitely better than most
		4|Tom|Barron|Teddy's Tennis Courts|1|TERRIBLE SERVICE! NOT COMMING BACK!
		5|Adam|Weil|Polly's Ice Cream|5|BEST Ice Cream EVERRRRRR


4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
	To select data from all three tables for one particular business, you would need to add a 'WHERE business_id = x' piece of syntax at the end. For example, to see all of the reviews on Polly's Ice Cream:

	(QUERY) --> SELECT * FROM reviews LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE business_id = 1;
	(OUTPUT)
		5|5|BEST Ice Cream EVERRRRRR|1|1|1|Polly's Ice Cream|1|Adam|Weil

	If you wanted to see everything on Bonnie's BQQ:

	(QUERY) --> SELECT * FROM reviews LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE business_id = 4;
	(OUTPUT)
		3|4|I've had a lot of BBQ, and this is definitely better than most|4|2|4|Bonnie's BBQ|2|Nicole|Murakami
