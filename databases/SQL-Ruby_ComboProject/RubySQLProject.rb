# Releases 0-3: Build Something Awesome
# So far in this course, you've had to satisfy a rubric by reading for detail, asking questions to resolve ambiguity, 
# and building programs to spec. These are crucial skills for a developer.

# But learning and self-development skills are important, too:

#    --> What do you do with your free time?
#    --> How do you find ways to push yourself when there's no one around to tell you what to do?
#    --> How do you find new ideas to explore when we aren't providing them as bullets?

# Your answers to these questions will have a huge impact on your success, and today is your first official opportunity to practice.
